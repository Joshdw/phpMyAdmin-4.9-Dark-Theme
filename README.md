## Install

Put the theme folder to your phpMyAdmin/themes folder
### XAMPP in Windows
\xampp\phpMyAdmin\themes
### MAMPP in MacOS
/Applications/MAMP/bin/phpMyAdmin

Make sure the folder is named **pmadarkmode**

Open phpMyAdmin dashboard, under Appearance settings change theme to **pmadarkmode**

Feel free to mess around with some of the variables for text color/bg color if you desire, in the layout.inc.php file.

RTL compatibility not tested.
